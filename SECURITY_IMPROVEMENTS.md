# Security Improvements Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines all the security enhancements implemented to protect the Óptica application from attacks, abuse, and unauthorized access.

---

## 1. ✅ JWT Token Expiration (8-hour limit)

**File:** `config/initializers/devise.rb`

**Change:**
- **Before:** `jwt.expiration_time = 1.day.to_i` (tokens valid for 24 hours)
- **After:** `jwt.expiration_time = 8.hours.to_i` (tokens valid for 8 hours)

**Benefits:**
- Limits window of exposure if a token is compromised
- Forces users to re-authenticate regularly
- Reduces risk of token theft from long-lived sessions
- Better for security-sensitive applications

---

## 2. ✅ Rate Limiting with Rack-Attack

**File:** `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb` (NEW)

**Implementation Details:**

### Throttle Rules:

| Rule | Limit | Period | Purpose |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `auth/ip` | 10 requests | 15 minutes | Prevent brute force login attacks |
| `api/ip` | 300 requests | 1 hour | Limit general API usage by IP |
| `api/write/ip` | 50 requests | 1 hour | Limit write operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) |
| `signup/ip` | 5 requests | 1 day | Prevent account enumeration & spam |
| `password-reset/ip` | 5 requests | 1 hour | Prevent password reset abuse |

**Response:**
- Returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Includes `Retry-After` header with seconds to wait
- Returns JSON with error details

**Benefits:**
- Prevents DDoS attacks
- Prevents brute force login attempts
- Prevents API abuse and resource exhaustion
- Prevents account creation spam
- Prevents password reset enumeration attacks

---

## 3. ✅ Security Headers Middleware

**File:** `app/middleware/security_headers_middleware.rb` (NEW)

**Headers Implemented:**

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```
default-src 'self'              # Only same-origin by default
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
img-src 'self' data: https:
font-src 'self' data:
connect-src 'self'              # Only API calls to same origin
frame-ancestors 'none'          # Prevent framing/clickjacking
form-action 'self'              # Form submissions to same origin only
```
**Protection:** XSS, code injection, clickjacking

### Clickjacking Prevention
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY           # Block all framing
```

### MIME-Type Sniffing Prevention
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff # Force correct MIME type
```

### XSS Protection (Legacy Browsers)
```
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

### Referrer Policy
```
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
# Only share domain for cross-origin navigation
```

### Permissions Policy
```
Disabled: geolocation, microphone, camera, payment
```

### HTTP Strict Transport Security (Production Only)
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
# Enforce HTTPS for 1 year
```

**Benefits:**
- Protects against XSS attacks
- Prevents code injection
- Prevents clickjacking
- Enforces HTTPS in production
- Restricts dangerous browser APIs

---

## 4. ✅ Enhanced CORS Configuration

**File:** `config/initializers/cors.rb` (Existing, already secure)

**Current Configuration:**
- Whitelist-based approach (only specific origins allowed)
- Development: `localhost:3000`, `localhost:5173`, `127.0.0.1`
- Production: Only HTTPS origins from verified domains
- Credentials allowed only from trusted origins

**Benefits:**
- Prevents Cross-Origin Resource Sharing abuse
- Only frontend applications can access the API
- Authenticated requests only from trusted sources

---

## 5. ✅ Input Validation & Sanitization

**Files:** 
- `app/controllers/api/v1/base_controller.rb` (Enhanced)
- `app/controllers/api/v1/users_controller.rb` (Enhanced)

### New Methods in BaseController:

#### `sanitize_params(params)`
- Removes HTML/script tags
- Prevents injection attacks
- Recursively sanitizes nested hashes/arrays

#### `validate_email_format(email)`
- Uses regex: `/\A[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+\z/`
- Prevents invalid email entries
- Blocks common spam patterns

#### `validate_password_strength(password)`
- Minimum 6 characters
- Prevents weak passwords
- Can be extended with:
  - Uppercase letters requirement
  - Numeric characters requirement
  - Special characters requirement

#### `log_security_event(event_type, details)`
- Logs all security-relevant events
- Includes: timestamp, user_id, IP, user_agent, path, method
- Helps with auditing and monitoring

### Enhanced UsersController Validations:

#### Index Endpoint
- Validates `role` parameter (must be "admin" or "sales")
- Returns 400 Bad Request for invalid input

#### Create Endpoint
- Email format validation
- Password strength validation
- Role validation
- Duplicate email check
- Security event logging

#### Update Endpoint
- Email format validation (if provided)
- Role validation (if provided)
- Duplicate email prevention
- Security event logging

#### Reset Password Endpoint
- Required password parameter check
- Password strength validation
- Prevents weak passwords
- Logs who reset the password

#### Delete Endpoint
- Prevents self-deletion
- Security event logging
- Tracks deleted user info

## 6. Middleware Stack Order

**File:** `config/application.rb`

```ruby
1. Rack::Attack (rate limiting & blocking)
2. SecurityHeadersMiddleware (security headers)
3. Rails middleware stack...
```

**Order matters:** Rate limiting happens first to block malicious IPs before other processing.

---

## Security Event Logging

All security-critical actions are logged:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T12:00:00Z",
  "event_type": "user_created",
  "user_id": 1,
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "path": "/api/v1/users",
  "method": "POST",
  "details": {
    "user_id": 123,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

**Logged Events:**
- `invalid_user_creation_attempt` - invalid input
- `user_creation_duplicate_email` - duplicate emails
- `user_created` - successful user creation
- `invalid_user_update` - invalid update attempt
- `user_updated` - successful user update
- `deletion_attempt_own_account` - self-deletion attempt
- `user_deleted` - successful user deletion
- `invalid_password_reset` - weak password
- `password_reset` - successful reset
- Other suspicious activities

---

## Testing the Security Features

### Test Rate Limiting:
```bash
# Simulate 15 login attempts in rapid succession
for i in {1..15}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/sign_in \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"user":{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password"}}'
done
# Should see 429 responses after 10 attempts
```

### Test Security Headers:
```bash
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users
# Check response headers for CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, etc.
```

### Test Input Validation:
```bash
# Invalid email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"user":{"email":"invalid-email","password":"password123","role":"admin"}}'
# Should return 400 Bad Request

# Weak password
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"user":{"email":"test@example.com","password":"123","role":"admin"}}'
# Should return 400 Bad Request with password strength error
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Monitor Rate Limiting Logs**
   - Check for repeated 429 responses
   - Investigate IP addresses with many failed attempts
   - Whitelist legitimate high-traffic services if needed

2. **Review Security Event Logs**
   - Look for patterns of invalid attempts
   - Monitor for enumeration attacks
   - Track all admin actions

3. **Update Thresholds**
   - Adjust rate limits based on legitimate usage
   - Increase limits for trusted services
   - Decrease limits if abuse is detected

4. **Security Headers Validation**
   - Test with browser dev tools
   - Verify CSP policy doesn't block legitimate resources
   - Monitor CSP violation reports (if enabled)
